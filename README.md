# 🤖 Intelligent HR Assistant – Multi-Agent AI Showcase

## 📌 Overview

The **Intelligent HR Assistant** is a cutting-edge, AI-driven internal support tool designed to automate and streamline HR and finance queries. Our solution uses a **multi-agent system** to smartly route and respond to employee questions based on topic—be it HR policy, budgeting, or general help.

We've implemented this assistant using **two leading orchestration frameworks** to demonstrate flexibility and expertise:
